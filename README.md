#####Question 2

The Interpolation Search is better than the Linear search because it divides the array by a mid value for each iteration
, thereby making it faster

#####Question 3
Improved Linear Search Time: 1500 nanoseconds which is 65.11627906976744% better than Linear Search

LOGIC: I replaced the last value of the array with my target value as a Sentinel
to act as a marker for the end of the array which eliminated the explicit check present in the Linear Search
